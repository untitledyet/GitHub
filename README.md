Symmetric Encryption

A matrix (list by list) is created according to the length of the encrypted text.
If the root does not rise to the length of the entered text, the text will be filled in with blanks until the length from which the root is removed is a natural number.
The entered text will be written in the matrix as follows:

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog  

[['T', 'h', 'e', ' ', 'q', 'u', 'i'], 
 ['c', 'k', ' ', 'b', 'r', 'o', 'w'], 
 ['n', ' ', 'f', 'o', 'x', ' ', 'j'], 
 ['u', 'm', 'p', 's', ' ', 'o', 'v'], 
 ['e', 'r', ' ', 't', 'h', 'e', ' '], 
 ['l', 'a', 'z', 'y', ' ', 'd', 'o'], 
 ['g', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ']]


Then we read the first character from each list and finally we get the encrypted text:   "Tcnuelghk mra e fp z  bosty qrx h  uo oed iwjv o "

The same script is used to encrypt encrypted text1
